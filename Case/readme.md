Hello here's ASH

So i'm making a case for this awesome pcb

The idea is to make a fully hand-crafted wood case, with high-profile and big bezels. It would be bottom mounted and entirely seamless. Angle of typing would be 5-7Â° and big 
fillets would allow for a round and coherent experience.

The model is being made in order to start prototyping maybe this week (03/22).

Another thing I'd like to add is a magnet system for the cable, as those fat bezels doesn't allow for standard hole.

TDL :
- Finish sketching
- Contact a local metal-worker to work on the plate
- 3d-model the plate
- 3d-model the case
- Prototype
- Fix a price
- Make an IC
